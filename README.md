### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size (100% responsiveness is still being worked on)
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about CSS flexbox and grid styles, html tags and elements.
Also learned about buttons and hover states.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  button:hover {
    border: 1px solid white;
    background-color: inherit;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on mobile responsiveness for all device types.
